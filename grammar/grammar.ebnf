  # A file starts with a single FileHeader, followed by one or more Header sections.

FileHeader  = "FileHeader" ; 
  # The first line of the file, containing information about the file.

Header      = "Header", { Passage | Question } ; 
  # A header introduces a new section, and can contain multiple Passages and/or Questions.

Passage     = "Passage", Content*, Question* ; 
  # A Passage can contain multiple Content lines and multiple Questions, which may or may not be present.

Content     = "Content" ; 
  # A Content line represents a block of text inside a Passage (e.g., a paragraph, description, etc.).

Question    = "Question", LearnMore? ; 
  # A Question is a prompt that may optionally be followed by a LearnMore explanation.

LearnMore   = "LearnMore" ; 
  # A LearnMore line provides additional information about the preceding Question.
